# BikeStore Analysis

### Overview
This project is part of my SQL portfolio where I performed data extraction, transformation, and analysis on a dataset involving bike store sales. The objective was to analyze customer purchases, calculate total revenue, and identify performance metrics for various product categories and sales representatives.

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to build a comprehensive dataset using SQL that showcases my skills in data manipulation and querying. I extracted data from multiple related tables, cleaned and transformed it using SQL joins, and finally created an interactive dashboard for analysis in Excel.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis includes multiple tables from a relational database representing a bike store's sales data. The key tables include:
- **Customers:** Contains customer information.
- **Orders:** Includes order IDs, dates, and associated customer details.
- **Order_Items:** Provides details on products purchased and quantities.
- **Products:** Contains product-level details like name and price.
- **Categories:** Defines product categories.
- **Stores:** Store locations and names.
- **Staffs:** Information on sales representatives.

### SQL Query
The core SQL query used in this project joins data from these tables to provide a holistic view of each sale, including customer details, products sold, revenue generated, and sales representatives involved.

### Key Analysis and Insights
- Total Revenue Analysis: Identified total revenue generated for each product sold by different stores.
- Product Sales Performance: Analyzed the number of units sold and categorized products based on their performance.
- Sales Representative Performance: Evaluated sales reps based on total revenue generated and total units sold.
- Regional Sales Analysis: Created insights on regional preferences for different bike categories.

### Results and Visualizations
- The output of the SQL query was exported to Excel and converted into a structured table, making it suitable for creating future Pivot Tables to summarize sales performance by product, category, and store. The data can be utilized to build visualizations that represent key metrics, such as revenue trends and product popularity, allowing for in-depth analysis and insightful decision-making.
